 scanf returns the no. of inputs it has successfully read and not the length 
 \b - backspace 
 \r - moves the chars and the following the cursor is pointing to to the beginning

gets() can read a string with spaces but a normal scanf() with %s can not.

To avoid Buffer Overflow, fgets() should be used instead of gets()

scanf("%4s", str);

reads maximum 4 characters :) not exactly
printf returns the no. of inputs it has successfully read and not including the \n 

y == z returns 1 in case of true else 0 :P :P 

int i = 1,2,3; is error while int i; i= 1,2,3; i is 1; i=(1,2,3) then i is 3

(++i)++ -- error

sizeof(k /= i + j). An expression doesn't get evaluated inside sizeof operator. sizeof operator returns sizeof(int) because the result of expression will be an integer. As the expression is not evaluated, value of k will not be changed.

Unary, ternary and assignment operators have right to left precedence 

 // Since a is 1, the expression --b is not executed because
   // of the short-circuit property of logical or operator
   // So c becomes 1, a and b remain 1
   int c = a || --b;

   // The post decrement operator -- returns the old value in current expression 
   // and then updates the value. So the value of expression --a is 1.  Since the 
   // first operand of logical and is 1, shortcircuiting doesn't happen here.  So 
   // the expression --b is executed and --b returns 0 because it is pre-increment.
   // The values of a and b become 0, and the value of d also becomes 0.
   int d = a-- && --b;


Be vary of non brace expressions :D 

fmod(f1,f2)

the statements if (i); and if (i) {} are equivalent.

In a switch block, the control directly flows within the case labels(or dafault label). So, statements which do not fall within these labels, Outside is not printed. 

An expression gets evaluated in a case label. Both the cases used are evaluated to 1(true). So compile-time error: duplicate case value is flashed as duplicated cases are not allowed.

The case labels must be constant inside switch block. Thats why the compile-time error: case label does not reduce to an integer constant is flashed.
